Questions & Answers
===================

If you have any questions about DeepXDE, first read the papers/slides and watch the video at the `DeepXDE homepage <https://deepxde.readthedocs.io>`_ and also check the following Q&A list. To get further help, you can open an issue in the GitHub "Issues" section.

- **Q**: DeepXDE failed to run.

  **A**: `#2`_, `#3`_, `#5`_

- **Q**: What is the expected output of DeepXDE?

  **A**: `#4`_, `#9`_, `#17`_

- **Q**: How can I define a new geometry?

  **A**: `#32`_

- **Q**: How can I implement new ODEs/PDEs?

  **A**: `#12`_, `#13`_, `#21`_, `#22`_

- **Q**: More details, explanations, and implementations about initial conditions.

  **A**: `#19`_

- **Q**: More details, explanations, and implementations about boundary conditions.
